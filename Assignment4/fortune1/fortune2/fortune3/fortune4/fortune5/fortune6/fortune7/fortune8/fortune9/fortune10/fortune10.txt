Ecclesiastes 7:15-18
15. In this meaningless life of mine I have seen both of these: a righteous man 
perishing in his righteousness, and a wicked man living long in his wickedness.
16. Do not be overrighteous, neither be overwise-- why destroy yourself?
17. Do not be overwicked, and do not be a fool-- why die before your time?
18. It is good to grasp the one and not let go of the other. The man who fears 
God will avoid all [extremes].
